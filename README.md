A research problem with Dr. Khang Tran - Truman State University
Problem: We are trying to find the locations of n points so that the product of all the gaps between each two points are maximum.
Approach: my approach is using genetic algorithm. First applying it to a linear but similar problem to analyze the efficiency of the problem. Then based on that, apply it to the square problem.
Scope: we want to be able to use the algorithm with all shapes in the future.
